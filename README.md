Implementing Temperature Switch and Clothing Item Feacture in my React Project
# Project 11 named WTWR 2026
WTWR in 2026 is a weather-based clothing recommendation app that suggests what to wear in 2026 based on current weather conditions.

# My Features Section are 
- Temperature unit toggle (°F/°C)
- Weather-based clothing recommendations
- Adding and removing clothing items

# React Routing and State Management
I am implementing in this project a toggle switch button for the temperature change 
between °C and °F, setting up my city, time and clothes option to be wearing depending to the weather to finally have option to add new clothes to wear using React router and context.  

React context is the way to do not pass data as props through multiple layers of components so that the Router can ensure that my url is synchronized with the inside of the application, share links to views, and help to see different content.

Mock API server being a tool that help on returning generated responses to a request

# The Technologies Section I have used
- React
- React Router
- React Context
- CSS
- json-server
- Vite

# Steps to run my project
Installing dependencies on running the command:"npm install" then "npm install react-router-dom@6" to download my new project.
Start my React app by: "cd se_project_react"
The exact json-server command:"json-server --watch db.json --id _id --port 3001"

# Steps to use my project are
- Switch the togglr button to have the specific Temperature
- Use Add Clothes to pup up the Modal Content in order to fill up the new garment
- Click on the cards to see the specific weather and name of the item
